# compile_time_dfs

This is an awesome homework project that I've done during the winter term of MADE Big Data Academy (Mail.ru) in 2020.

Depth first search using templates! 
It calculates everything in ***compile time*** so when the program is executed it just prints the answer, nothing else is happening in runtime! 

_side note: I wrote the dfs itself (dfs.h) while everything else was provided as a part of the homework._
